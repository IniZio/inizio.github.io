# First taste with angular js and npm and such
I am pretty late to the party, to be honest. I thought the most important part in web projects are backends, and therefore I learnt mostly about Codeigniter and PHP in past year. However the fast-growing trend of preprocessing in frontend really amazed me, where you do not need to stare at countless rows of css anywhere. There are so many choices of tools, frameworks and workflows. In fact I have been hesitating so much I haven not learnt much from shopping through all of them.

# Maybe I really need to build something first
I never am a good executer. I love dreaming flawless, extensible and upgradable models and frameworks, just never get my hands dirty to make them real...

My project will be a one month project. Within this month I will finish a raw yet fully-functional website first.
It will be for a personal knowledge portal. In short it will be like 'write whatever I want that might be useful. Make it even more useful when I need it'.

For the first month I will just make saving links easier and organized using tags. I want to use angular js and save to firebase. I will try to keep as few components as possible to waste less time extending to mobile version as well.
